## Current Focus

*   [2025-04-10 16:43:03] - Completing Memory Bank Update (UMB) process.
[2025-04-10 17:35:42] - Lesson completion now triggers re-parse and re-link of words, guaranteeing accurate per-language reading statistics. User confirmed fix is effective.
*   [2025-04-10 18:43:30] - Statistics page: Resolved persistent bug with period-specific per-language stats (reading/listening) by correcting frontend mapping of API data (object-to-language mapping, robust handling of data shape, and timezone). User confirmed all periods now display correctly.
*   [2025-04-10 18:43:30] - Audiobook player: Added volume slider, styled for both themes, and implemented mute toggle via speaker icon. User confirmed both features work as intended.
*   [2025-04-10 18:57:02] - Reset Statistics feature: Implemented backend endpoint and frontend button (in User Settings > Data Management) to allow resetting only user statistics (activities, aggregate counts) while preserving other data. Debugged and confirmed button visibility and placement.
