## Current Focus

*   [2025-04-10 16:43:03] - Completing Memory Bank Update (UMB) process.
[2025-04-10 17:35:42] - Lesson completion now triggers re-parse and re-link of words, guaranteeing accurate per-language reading statistics. User confirmed fix is effective.
*   [2025-04-10 18:43:30] - Statistics page: Resolved persistent bug with period-specific per-language stats (reading/listening) by correcting frontend mapping of API data (object-to-language mapping, robust handling of data shape, and timezone). User confirmed all periods now display correctly.
*   [2025-04-10 18:43:30] - Audiobook player: Added volume slider, styled for both themes, and implemented mute toggle via speaker icon. User confirmed both features work as intended.
*   [2025-04-10 18:57:02] - Reset Statistics feature: Implemented backend endpoint and frontend button (in User Settings > Data Management) to allow resetting only user statistics (activities, aggregate counts) while preserving other data. Debugged and confirmed button visibility and placement.
*   [2025-04-11 00:01:37] - Completed debugging and fixing the batch translation workflow. Issues addressed included incorrect frontend endpoint usage, backend duplicate key errors (fixed with upsert logic), and frontend UI refresh problems (fixed state update logic).
*   [2025-04-11 00:07:35] - Fixed audiobook progress loss bug by patching the frontend to save progress immediately on track change, ensuring backend always has latest position.
*   [2025-04-11 09:12:46] - Fixed audio lesson progress loss: Implemented backend storage (`UserAudioLessonProgress` table, API endpoints) and updated frontend (`TextDisplay.js`) to use API instead of localStorage.
*   [2025-04-11 09:33:03] - Fixed batch translation UI refresh issue: Corrected state update logic in `TextDisplay.js` (`fetchAllLanguageWords`) to fully replace local state with fetched data, ensuring immediate UI update after batch translation and save.

## Recent Changes

*   [2025-04-10 16:43:03] - Gathered project info (README, files, code structure).
*   [2025-04-10 16:43:03] - Created documentation plan (`documentation_plan.md`).
*   [2025-04-10 16:43:03] - Created full documentation draft (`FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md`).
*   [2025-04-10 16:43:03] - Initialized Memory Bank structure.
*   [2025-04-10 16:43:03] - Updated `productContext.md`.
*   [2025-04-10 22:58:39] - Corrected frontend batch translation workflow (`client/lingua-read-client/src/utils/api.js`, `client/lingua-read-client/src/pages/TextDisplay.js`) to use two-step fetch/save process (`/api/translation/batch` then `/api/words/batch`).
*   [2025-04-10 23:36:02] - Implemented upsert logic in backend `WordsController.AddTermsBatch` (`server/LinguaReadApi/Controllers/WordsController.cs`) to handle duplicate terms during batch save, resolving unique constraint errors.
*   [2025-04-10 23:39:49] - Fixed frontend state update logic in `TextDisplay.js` (`fetchAllLanguageWords` function) to fully replace state after batch save, ensuring immediate UI refresh.
