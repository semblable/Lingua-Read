## Completed Tasks

*   [2025-04-10 16:43:37] - Gathered project information (README, file structure, code analysis).
*   [2025-04-10 16:43:37] - Created documentation plan (`documentation_plan.md`).
*   [2025-04-10 16:43:37] - Generated full documentation draft (`FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md`).
*   [2025-04-10 16:43:37] - Initialized Memory Bank structure.




*   [2025-04-11 09:33:47] - Fixed batch translation UI refresh issue: Corrected state update logic in `TextDisplay.js` (`fetchAllLanguageWords`) to fully replace local state with fetched data, ensuring immediate UI update after batch translation and save.
*   [2025-04-11 09:13:16] - Fixed audio lesson progress loss: Implemented backend storage (`UserAudioLessonProgress` table, API endpoints) and updated frontend (`TextDisplay.js`) to use API instead of localStorage.
*   [2025-04-11 00:07:48] - Fixed audiobook progress loss issue by patching frontend to save progress immediately on track change, ensuring backend always has latest position.
*
*   [2025-04-10 18:43:58] - Fixed statistics page bug: period-specific per-language stats (reading/listening) now display correctly for all periods. User confirmed resolution.
*   [2025-04-10 18:43:58] - Implemented and confirmed audiobook player enhancements: volume slider and mute toggle via speaker icon.
*   [2025-04-10 18:58:01] - Implemented "Reset Statistics" feature (backend endpoint, frontend button in User Settings). Verified implementation and visibility.

## Current Tasks

*   [2025-04-10 23:39:49] - Resolved batch translation issues: Corrected frontend workflow (`TextDisplay.js`, `api.js`) for fetch/save. Fixed backend (`WordsController.AddTermsBatch`) upsert logic for duplicates. Fixed frontend (`TextDisplay.js`) state update logic (`fetchAllLanguageWords`) to fully replace state after save, ensuring immediate UI refresh.
*   [2025-04-11 00:03:29] - Completed full debugging and fix cycle for batch translation: fixed API usage, backend upsert, and frontend UI refresh. Batch translation and saving now work smoothly without manual refresh.

## Next Steps

*   [2025-04-10 16:43:37] - Finalize UMB and confirm completion (if applicable).
*   [2025-04-10 23:39:49] - Verify batch translation functionality in the UI (should now save correctly, handle duplicates, and update UI automatically).
